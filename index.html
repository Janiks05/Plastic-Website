            Water pollution through plastic is not the only problem. Even our
            nature is polluted, with plastic waste and litter all over the
            place. On every Sidewalk, on every playground and in every ditch you
            find plastic waste. It's dangerous because the problem we have with
            plastic underwater, we have in our environment too. Animales are
            eating plastic and so the plastic comes in our food. So, many
            animals die or tourtre themselves because of it. Therefore plastic
            is a threat not only to our environment, groundwater or Animals,
            it's a threat for us. We consume those animales, which are crammed
            full of plastic and this is concerning.

            Pollution of our oceans is one of the greatest challenges humanity has to tackle. but how can so much plastic reach our oceans? One of the greatest providers for plastic in our Oceans are rivers. Only 20% of plastic is thrown into oceans. The rest of the plastic is carried through rivers. Ten Rivers are responsible for 90% of plastic waste in our oceans. That number is astonishing. Seabirds, Fish and other marine life are dying through plastic in their bodies. We eat them. Fish and seabirds are crammed full of plastic and we are responsible. 
It's cruel that we contaminate marine life with plastic debris and eat them afterwards.
