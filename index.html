        <h2>Garbage in the Ocean</h2>
        <p>
         Pollution of our oceans is one of the greatest challenges humanity has to tackle. But how can so much plastic reach our oceans? One of the greatest providers (Zulieferer) of plastic in our oceans are rivers. Only 20% of plastic is thrown into oceans. The rest of the plastic is carried through rivers. Ten rivers are responsible for 90% of plastic waste in our oceans. That number is astonishing (erstaunlich). Seabirds, fish and other marine life are dying through plastic in their bodies. We are responsible. 
It's cruel that we contaminate (verschmutzen) marine life with plastic debris and eat them afterwards. It’s crystal clear that it is not healthy.

        <h2>Garbage everywhere</h2>
        <p>
         Water pollution through plastic is not the only problem. Even our nature is polluted with plastic waste all over the place. On every sidewalk, on every playground and in every ditch you find litter. It's dangerous because the problem we have with plastic underwater, we have in our environment too. Animals are eating plastic, and so the plastic comes in our food. So, many animals die or torture themselves because of it. Therefore, plastic is a threat not only to our environment, groundwater or Animals, it's a threat to us. Plastic waste can only decompose in 450 years. Every effect we have on our environment now will last for this long time. We have to stop this!

        <h2>What can you do?</h2>
        <p>
         What can you do against water pollution?
Actually it’s very simple. You only have to recycle your waste and widen your view about your daily plastic usage. So you may come to the conclusion to use less. If you are really ambitious you can inform others about the problems plastic brings with it and maybe convince others about the need to use less plastic. Humankind can achieve wonders if enough people are involved and motivated.
